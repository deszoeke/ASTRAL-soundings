Atmospheric stratification and mixed layers in the monsoon

The atmosphere over the Arabian Sea was observed in the July 2023 monsoon
by radiosondes released from the research vessel Revelle
after the passage of tropical cyclone Biparjoy.
A stack of mixed layers with either adiabatic or moist adiabatic density 
structures is observed:
(1) an adiabatic subcloud layer,
(2) a moist-adiabatic shallow cumulus layer,
(3) an adiabatic mixed layer June 17-20,
(4) a moist-adiabatic dry layer above 600 hPa.
The cumulus layer is shallow, consistent with
previous work.
The role of the mixed layers 
in drying the lower troposphere, 
vertically trapping the shallow cumulus layer, and inhibiting 
precipitating deep convection is investigated
with large eddy simulations and reanalysis.
Geostrophic monsoon winds have strong jets and wind shear.
A proposed mechanisms is that 
shear-generated mechanical mixing homogenizes layers
above the shallow cumulus plantetary boundary layer (PBL),
keeping the top of the PBL shallow
and capped by a stable inversion.
